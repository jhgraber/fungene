Experiment Description	<p>Previous studies of zebrafish caudal fin regeneration have shown that multiple genetic programs are moduled through regulatory factors.  We characterized mRNA expression during zebrafish caudal fin regeneration at 0 and 4 days post amputation.</p><p>Experiment Overall Design: Zebrafish caudal fin tissues were gathered at 0 and 4dpa.</p>

Protocol Type	grow	specified_biomaterial_action	nucleic_acid_extraction
Protocol Description	Fish were maintained at 27oC until under standard conditions.	Adult Ekkwill (EK) zebrafish were housed and maintained in tanks at 22oC and exposed to a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle.	"Total RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) following manufacturerÌ¢???s protocol. Illumina TruSeq small RNA and strand-specific PolyA+ mRNA libraries."
