# The MGED Ontology

An ontology for microarray experiments in support of MAGE v.1.

## Desciption
Concepts, definitions, terms, and resources for standardized description of a microarray experiment in support of MAGE v.1. The MGED ontology is divided into the MGED Core ontology which is intended to be stable and in synch with MAGE v.1; and the MGED Extended ontology which adds further associations and classes not found in MAGE v.1.


## The MO mission statement:
 
The primary purpose of the MGED Ontology is to provide standard terms 
for the annotation of microarray experiments. 

These terms will enable structured queries on elements of the experiments. 
Furthermore, the terms will also enable unambiguous descriptions of how the experiment was performed. The terms will be provided in the form of ontology; which means that the terms will be organized into classes with properties and will be defined. The standard ontology format OWL will be used. For descriptions of biological material (biomaterial) and certain treatments used in the experiment, terms may come from external resources that are specified in the Ontology. Software programs utilizing the Ontology are expected to generate forms for annotation, populate databases directly, or generate files in the established MAGE-ML format. Thus, the Ontology will be used directly by investigators annotating their microarray experiments as well as by software and database developers and therefore will be developed with these very practical applications in mind.
