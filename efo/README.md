# The Experiment Factor Ontology

An ontology for various experiments in support of MAGE v.1.

## Desciption
The Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) provides a systematic description of many experimental variables available in EBI databases, and for external projects such as the NHGRI GWAS catalog. It combines parts of several biological ontologies, such as UBERON anatomy, ChEBI chemical compounds, and Cell Ontology. The scope of EFO is to support the annotation, analysis and visualization of data handled by many groups at the EBI and as the core ontology for Open Targets. EFO is developed by the EMBL-EBI Samples, Phenotypes and Ontologies Team (SPOT).
